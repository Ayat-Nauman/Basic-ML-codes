# Simple ML Regression Models

This repository contains basic implementations of three common regression algorithms using Python and scikit-learn:

- Simple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Tree Regression

The goal is to provide simple, understandable examples for each regression type. These are suitable for beginners learning the basics of machine learning and regression analysis.


### File Descriptions

- **class_task.py**  
  Contains the main class tasks or assignments that apply or demonstrate the usage of the different regression models implemented in separate files.

- **linear_regression.py**  
  Implements simple linear regression using scikit-learn. This model is used to predict a continuous target variable based on a single feature.

- **polynomial_regression.py**  
  Demonstrates polynomial regression by transforming the input features into polynomial features and fitting a linear model on them.

- **decision_tree_regression.py**  
  Uses a decision tree regressor to model non-linear relationships in the data.

## Requirements
