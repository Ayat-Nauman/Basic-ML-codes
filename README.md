# Simple ML Regression Models

This repository contains basic implementations of three common regression algorithms using Python and scikit-learn:

- Simple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Tree Regression

The goal is to provide simple, understandable examples for each regression type. These are suitable for beginners learning the basics of machine learning and regression analysis.

### Dataset 
The dataset is present inside the Simple Linear Regression folder.

### File Descriptions

- **class_task.py**  
  Contains the main class tasks or assignments that apply or demonstrate the usage of the different regression models implemented in separate files.

### Main dependencies:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. scikit-learn

### License
This project is for educational purposes only.

## Requirements
